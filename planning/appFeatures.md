## Question Answer Approach

**Multi vs Single Page:** Multi page app makes more sense for this

- The right answer is always stored as option_1 in the questions database. The ordering of the options will be randomized when the page is rendered 

Features
**Create Quizzes**
- User can create quizzes
- User can choose to make their quizzes public or private, if public it should show on the home page 
- User can publish quizzes 

**Sharing quizzes**
- User can share link to quizzes they create
- People with the link can attempt a quiz

**Taking Quiz**
- User can select a quiz and answer it 
- Once user clicks submit quiz, a new page loads with the score, the user is then able to share their score via url 
- The score only is the amount of questions they got right, we won't tell them which questions they got wrong
